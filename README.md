# ML sources
Original papers for prominent ML algorithms.

I can never remember where a given ML algorithm actually came from, and I'm tired of googling "SGS algorithm source". Papers are organized by topic (and duplicated when they span topics). The standard for notability is "the algorithm has a name and I've heard of it". I try to link to the citable version (i.e. conference publication), but ultiamtely I'm lazy and if arXiv comes up first on Google I'm linking that. I also link to the Semantic Scholar page because that's what I use to organize my research.

## Causality

### Causal Discovery
* PC: [An Algorithm for Fast Recovery of Sparse Causal Graphs ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/089443939100900106)
    * [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/An-Algorithm-for-Fast-Recovery-of-Sparse-Causal-Spirtes-Glymour/ade157c4ddb211819914c17e4efde6d33489e3b5)
    * *Causation, Prediction, Search* often gets cited as well, even by the authors. Talk to your doctor about which reference is right for you.
