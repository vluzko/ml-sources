# ML sources
Original papers for prominent ML algorithms.

I can never remember where a given ML algorithm actually came from, and I'm tired of googling "SGS algorithm paper". Papers are organized by topic (and duplicated when they span topics). The standard for notability is "the algorithm has a name and I've heard of it". I try to link to the citable version (i.e. conference publication), but ultimately I'm lazy and if arXiv comes up first on Google I'm linking that until someone corrects me. I also link to the Semantic Scholar page because that's what I use to organize my research.
